Status report 2: 4/16/16

What we accomplished during the week:

* started working on backend (in different repo: https://github.com/kislam01/group-proj-server.git)
* began setting up mongo

Challenges:

* meeting together (everyone had a busy week)
* unsure whether backend should have a separate repo

Planned for next week:

* continue working on server side - data to be stored for events include
** coordinates
** username
** description
** title
* start working on client side (grabbing and displaying data out of database)
