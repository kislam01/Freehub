Status report 1: 4/8/16

What we accomplished during the week:
* barebones index.html with Google Maps API
* login page using Bootstrap. redirects to homepage upon signin
* in progress: authentication with Facebook

Challenges:
* overlay (but same page) for login. Solved by making a separate login page.
* unsure how to implement database.

Planned for next week:
* Setting up a profile page.
* backend database with MongoDB or MySQL.
* setting up markers on Google Maps for events.

Comments by Ming:
* "unsure how to implement database." --what I would do, list all the data that you need to read/write.  You need a table or collection for events, but what data for an event (e.g., location, date, time, etc).
* "Setting up a profile page." --this is not as important as identifying your data collection design and for events.
