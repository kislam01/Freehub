Status report 3: 4/24/16

What we accomplished during the week:

* set up the server to return data with the POST/sendData api(in different repo: https://github.com/kislam01/group-proj-server.git)
* worked on Bootstrap to set up drop-down menus

Challenges:

* meeting together (everyone had a busy week)
* fixing bugs in the server
* understanding and using bootstrap 

Planned for next week:

* start working on client-side code 
* set up Facebook login

#Comments by Ming
* Good workflow, dealing with client last.
* "unsure whether backend should have a separate repo" => yes, it makes sense especially these days.  Having one monolithic codebase is very complex to deal with.
