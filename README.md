Project title:

	FreeHub
	
Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?):

	College students are always strapped for cash and in need of food.

How do you solve the problem:

	Our project will allow users to input events that offer free food. These events will be shown on a Google Maps overlay for any website vistor to see.

List of all the features that your team will implement (including which of the "Pick 4" items were chosen by the team). Your team will be held accountable for the features you list:

	Geolocation - a map will center itself around the user's current location and display events around them
	Server-side data persistence - data to be stored server-side includes events and account info
	Front-end framework - 
	sending Emails/SMS - users will be notified when an event is coming up

What data will your prototype be using and collecting:

	Location, Time, Type of Food offered, Description of event and the event hoster

Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary:

	Registration and password encryption.

Electronic mockups of what your team will be developing using wireframes. No hand-drawn mockups accepted. Tools to create wireframes include Balsamiq (commercial; de facto standard), Gliffy, MockFlow, and even Microsoft PowerPoint:

	The mockups are included as seperate image files.

* "Geolocation, Server-side data persistence, Front-end framework and sending Emails/SMS" --those are not features.  Describe what you will be using geolocation, SMS, etc. for --what will the user be doing?  Example: "Automatically sends SMSes to users when free food is detected near you."  No third-party APIs and/or data sets to be used listed.  You listed "Registration" under special techniques but didn't list the registration data to be collected.  Heads-up: idea is short on originality.
